# WHATWG Considerations for Individual participation by Steering Group Invitation Policy

## Joining the WHATWG via Steering Group Invitation

Persons who wish to join the WHATWG and participate in their personal capacity 
(the <a id="requestor">**Requestor**</a>), but for various reasons are unable to sign the 
[Contributor and Workstream Participant Agreement] under any of the existing terms
(for example, the [Individual] is working in the [Field of Web Technologies] or the
[Entity] employing the individual is unable to join), may request special 
<a id="sg-invitation">**Steering Group Invitation**</a> status. This policy describes the conditions and
procedures for this process.

The [Steering Group] expects to grant [invitations][Steering Group Invitation] sparingly. 
Wherever possible, persons employed by, contracting, or otherwise working for an
[Entity] shouldseek to have the Entity execute the
[Contributor and Workstream Participant Agreement].

The [Steering Group] must approve an invitation by unanimous consent.

## How to request Steering Group Invitation status

1.	File an issue in the [WHATWG/sg](https://github.com/whatwg/sg/issues) repo requesting
    [Steering Group Invitation] status along with other relevant details or information 
    relevant to the request.
2.	The [Steering Group] will discuss the matter with the [Requestor] in the issue.
3.	Either the [Requestor] or the [Steering Group] may request a private meeting to discuss
    confidential special considerations.
4.	Each [Steering Group Member] must indicate support in the issue (for example by a "+1"
    or explicit indication of support).
5.	Once all [Steering Group Members] have indicated support, the [Requestor]’s information
    is added to a database, and the [Requestor] is invited to sign the 
    [Contributor and Workstream Participant Agreement] as an [Individual] with 
    [Steering Group Invitation] status.
    
## Steering Group decision considerations

The [Steering Group] reserves the right to approve or reject a request for a 
[Steering Group Invitation] for any reason.

Some factors that the [Steering Group] will consider when evaluating a request 
are (but are not limited to):

* Hardship or difficulty in getting approval for a related [Entity] to join.
* The type and nature of the related [Entity] and potential IPR concerns.
*	The expected value of the potential participant’s [Contributions].
*	The degree of involvement to which the [Individual] or [Entity] is in the
  [Field of Web Technologies].
*	Other specific circumstances related to the [Individual] or [Entity].

## Pre-approval

A person wishing to join the WHATWG using the [Steering Group Invitation] status 
must be pre-approved *before* attempting to sign the 
[Contributor and Workstream Participant Agreement]. Once pre-approval, 
as noted above, has been granted, the person may sign as an [Individual] with
[Steering Group Invitation] status. Otherwise, the attempt to sign the agreement
will fail.

## Cancelation of Steering Group Invitation

The [Steering Group] reserves the right to terminate the [Steering Group Invitation]
status as indicated in [Termination]. The person may re-execute 
[the agreement][Contributor and Workstream Participant Agreement] under any of the
other existing terms, but will no longer be able to use the 
[Steering Group Invitation] status.
